### What I learned

Hi everyone, in this challenge I had some difficulties regarding the management of form errors, in particular regarding the control of the text inserted in the various inputs, and that it was in line with the characters allowed for each type of input.

Also regarding the **card number** field as I had to understand how to automatically divide the numbers into blocks of 4, but thanks to the help of some online resources, I was able to understand how it might work; it was a good workout ;)

### Continued development

I feel like I have to continue a lot with **Javascript** and understand well the various logics to different commonly used problems regarding front-end development, and to do that I have to practice, nothing else ;)

### Useful resources

I found some great resources on some https://stackoverflow.com/ threads that helped me understand the problem better.
